## 1. What questions would you ask to each of the team?
- **Product Owner / Business Analyst**:  
  - What is the main business goal of the feature?  
  - What are the success metrics?  
  - Are there any constraints or priorities we should be aware of?  

- **UX/UI Designer**:  
  - Can you share the design prototypes and style guide?  
  - Are there any accessibility requirements?  
  - How do you envision the interaction patterns for this feature?  

- **Backend / API Team**:  
  - What endpoints are available or need to be created?  
  - What is the expected request/response format?  
  - Are there any authentication or rate limit considerations?  

- **QA Team**:  
  - What test scenarios are already defined?  
  - Are there automated tests in place or will they be manual?
